Variable-angle-tow (VAT) laminated plate means the fiber path is no longer straight for each layer in composite structure.

The code works for thermal buckling analysis of VAT laminated plate subjected to a uniform temperature change.
Code applies for examples in Table 7


%% # TO DO LISTS
% 1) TO add static/mechanical buckling/vibration/forced vibration/prestressed vibration analysis solvers for PLATE;
% 2) To use different parameterization methods for VAT fiber plies;


% ==================================================
0. "Thermal_buckling_plate_validation_Duran.m" is the main code working for case (c) in Table 7 in the attached paper;
1. Plate geometry can be modified in lines 60-62;
2. Material properties can be modified in lines 132-141;
3. Fiber ply orientations can be modified in line 144;

Note: The current program is NOT ALLOWED to be shared with any other persons till the paper gets published.
