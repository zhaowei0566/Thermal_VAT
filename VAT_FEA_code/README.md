# Thermal buckling analysis: 

Main code: \
        ```Thermal_buckling_plate_validation_Duran.m``` \
        - using Duran's model for analysis\
        - Present results in two cases are not same with Duran's results but close with NASTRAN/ABAQUS results, check the attached manuscript for details

        
The code is mainly used for conducting thermal buckling analysis of VAT laminated plate by using example in Duran's paper [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822314007314](url)

```$$ Change the material name in Line 104 for different material cases.```
