Variable-angle-tow (VAT) laminated plate means the fiber path is no longer straight for each layer in composite structure.

The code works for thermal buckling analysis of VAT laminated plate subjected to a uniform temperature change.
Code applies for examples in Table 7


%% # TO DO LISTS
% 1) TO add static/mechanical buckling/vibration/forced vibration/prestressed vibration analysis solvers for PLATE;
% 2) To use different parameterization methods for VAT fiber plies;
