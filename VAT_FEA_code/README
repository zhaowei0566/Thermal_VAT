Thermal buckling analysis: Thermal_buckling_plate_validation_Duran.m
        - using Duran's model for analysis
        - Present results in two cases are not same with Duran's results but close with NASTRAN/ABAQUS results, check the attached manuscript for details

        
The code is mainly used for conducting thermal buckling analysis of VAT laminated plate by using example in Duran's paper.

$$ Change the material name in Line 104 for different material cases.
